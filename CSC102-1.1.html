        I want you to think about this for a second, we have only explored 5% of the ocean depth, leaving the rest, deeper parts largely unknown. This leaves a big chunk of our planet remaining in mystery, now compare that to space. Space is filled with countless planets, stars, glaxies, etc. Human space exploration has only reached as far as the moon, while sending satellite and probes venturing out to the outer edges of our solar system. Beyond that, we've only observed with telescopes.
